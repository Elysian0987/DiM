# Coffee & Cozy

A modern and elegant book review journal built with React. This project features a clean, content-focused design with dynamic routing for curated reading lists and individual reviews.

## Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to run the project on a new machine.

### 1. Navigate to the App Directory

First, ensure your terminal is inside the main `dim` folder. Then, navigate into the React app folder.

```bash
cd monsoon-book-nook
````

### 2\. Install Dependencies

This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all required libraries, including React and React Router.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3\. Run the Local Development Server

This command starts the app and opens it in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm start
```

The server features hot-reloading, so the browser will automatically update whenever you save a code change.

```
```
