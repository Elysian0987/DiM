      <h2>About the Bookworm</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm a student in Mumbai who believes the best companion during the monsoon is a really good book.
        This little website is my personal project to share the stories that have captivated me.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favourite genres are mystery, fantasy, and contemporary fiction. Hope you find something you like here!
